# RavenCFG
A CFG mod menu for WaW Zombies, pushing CFG to its limits.


# What is Raven?
Raven is a CFG "mod menu" for Call of Duty 5, World at War. More specifically, it's for the zombies gamemode as that is the only gamemode in the game that has an active playerbase anymore.
The goal for Raven is to push the capabilities of CFG "programming" to its limits, seeing what is and isn't possible by just chaining together developer commands.

# Why Raven?
Well, the CFG modding community has long since fallen quiet. As newer CoD games came out, CFG either became a difficult thing to accomplish (try finding a clean version of Red-Eye's MW2 Game Save Editor.), or (with later games) became something that just couldn't be done.
Long gone are the days of 2009-2012, where random 15 year olds would make competing CFG mods in games like WaW and MW, battling it out to see who can steal more code from who, before eventually getting hit with a set of bad DVARs from someone with an actual mod menu, or getting booted offline.
Raven wont bring the community back to life, not by any stretch of the imagination. But it may be a nice closing statement, and a proud, final mark of the CFG community.

# Why not make an actual *mod menu?*
Well, 2 reasons.
1. Modding in WaW is again, long since fallen quiet. Most tools don't exist to make mods anymore, and most people don't play the game.
2. While the modding scene is "dying" still in BO2 among other games, tools for those games still do exist. Once I gain a bit more programming expirience (and can be assed to finally jailbreak my PS3), RavenCFW will be made for BO2.

# Isn't modding in Call of Duty dead?
In a sense, yes. And it makes me sad to think about that. I do occasionally miss the days where running into a modder on BO2 was a rare occurence, where for a small amount of time you would have a chance to have a unique expirience of the game. But, as the playerbase left the older games on console and PC, and as modders became both a more regular occurance as well as an easier thing to accomplish (with people far more skilled than I being able to write theatre mode exploits...maybe someday.), I know *someday* I'm going to have to bite the bullet and make a proper *cheat* for a modern Call of Duty game to stay in the scene.

# Whats the plan for Raven?
Current roadmap looks like this:
1. Relase RavenCFG, and update it until I can no longer add any more unique or fun features to it, either by limitations of myself or by limitions of CFG.
2. Eventually start work on and release RavenCFW, the more refined version of RavenCFG, for BO2. Repeat step one to it.
3. Someday, when I have gained enough programming expirience and knowledge, create **Raven**, a proper *cheat* for a modern Call of Duty title.

# How to install RavenCFG?
A detailed video will be posted with details of how to install soon.
